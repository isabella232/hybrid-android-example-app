# Klarna In-App SDK - Hybrid Android Demo App
![Platforms](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-android-lightgrey)
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/klarna/klarna-mobile-sdk)](https://github.com/klarna/klarna-mobile-sdk/blob/master/LICENSE)

This is an example Android app to demonstrate the hybrid integration of [Klarna In-App SDK](https://github.com/klarna/klarna-mobile-sdk).

The Klarna In-App SDK allows merchants to natively integrate Klarna’s products into their apps. This means that you can add services like Klarna Payments to your app and let your customers pay with our payment methods.

## What Does Klarna In-App SDK Offer?
Klarna In-App SDK offers two integration approaches: **Native integration** and **Hybrid integration** (showcased in this demo app).

Native integration allows fully native apps to add views with Klarna content to their app. We currently support Klarna Payments, allowing you to add payment views to your checkout and authorizing a session to create an order natively.

Hybrid integration will enhance your customers' experience if your app renders in a web view that presents content from Klarna.

## Setup

* Open the project and run the `app` configuration.

### Hybrid Integration
Our iOS and Android SDKs hold weak references to your web views, don’t override any part of your implementation or modify your web views in any way. Because of this, we ask you to perform some minor integration work to make your users’ experience as pleasant as possible. This consists of four steps:

1. Initialization.
2. Adding web views to the SDK.
3. Notifying the SDK when something occurs in the web view.
4. Handling events from the SDK.

These are our Android-specific guides for the In-App SDK. We currently have guides to get you started, to integrate Klarna Payments and to perform a hybrid integration.

### Fullscreen Events
Your app should handle specific events that you might receive from the SDK, which allow you to move your web view to a fullscreen presentation in the way that is most suitable for your app. The solution demonstrated in the demo app is just one of the many available solutions that you can use.

Before submitting a bug report, please check that the issue hasn't been reported before. If you find a *Closed* issue that seem to describe an issue that is similar to what you want to report, open a new issue and link to the original issue in the new one. When you have checked that the issue hasn't been reported before **fill out [the required template](https://github.com/klarna/klarna-mobile-sdk/blob/a55293185f73609df831a26ddff5a66033f21e55/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)** which will help us resolve the issue faster. 

##### Submitting a Bug Report
Bugs that are submitted are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). To report a bug, create an issue and use [the template](https://github.com/klarna/klarna-mobile-sdk/blob/a55293185f73609df831a26ddff5a66033f21e55/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) to provide information about the bug. Explain the problem thoroughly and include any additional information that you think might help the maintainers reproduce the issue. When creating the GitHub issue please make sure that you:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** with as many details as possible. It's generally better to provide too much than too little information.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and explain exactly what the problem is with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected instead** and why.
* **Provide screenshots and/or screen recordings** that might help explain the issue you are facing. To screen record a phone connected to Android Studio or an emulator follow the steps [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/am-video). To screen record on iOS follow the steps described [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935).
* **Include relevant logs in the bug report** by putting it in a [code block](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github#multiple-lines), a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests) or in a [gist](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-gists) and provide a link to that gist.
* **Tell how recently you started having the issue.** When was the first time you experienced the issue and was it after updating the SDK version? Or has it always been a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce it in an older version of the SDK?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, explain how often it occurs and under what conditions it normally happens. For example in what environment you are running.

Include details about the device/emulator/simulator you are experiencing the issue on:

* **Which version of the SDK are you using?**
* **Which OS is this a problem in, iOS, Android or both?** What version(s)? Also add the appropriate label to the issue.
* **Did you experience the issue in simulator/emulator or on real device(s)?**
